  <p>Shalom is the Hebrew word for peace, an inward sense of wholeness. It is also the name of the <strong>Spiritual Health And Life-Orientation Measure (SHALOM),</strong> an assessment used by psychologists, spiritual counselors, and ministers in hospitals, schools, and community centers all over the world. 
  </p>
  <p>We will be using it here to assess your <strong>Spiritual Fitness.</strong> Here's what you need to know about it:

  <hr class="invisible">
  <ol>
    <li><strong>It is non-denominational.</strong> That means it does not require you to believe in anything in particular, or identify with any religion.</li>
    <li><strong>It is generalizing.</strong> You will be sorted into one of four statistically-modeled "spiritual types." These are not religions, they are simply generalized orientations toward life and spiritual practice.</li>
    <li><strong>You set your own standards.</strong> You're in the driver's seat! You will only be assessed against the beliefs and practices that matter to you.</li>
  </ol>
